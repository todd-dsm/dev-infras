# dev-infras

A starting point for learning Terraform basics. This is a small ecosystem for quick, consistent per-environment creation.

FORK THIS REPO TO YOUR OWN _**PERSONAL**_ GITHUB SPACE BEFORE EXPERIMENTING.

## Getting Started

Check the docs for [one-time setup steps]. 

You can follow along with [the slides] if you like.

You'll need to use your own SSH Key; here's how to [generate and upload] one. Change the value for `instance.tf` (file) > `aws_instance` (resource) > [key_name].

Extra credit: _**HOW WOULD YOU VARIABLIZE THIS VALUE?**_

HINT: this works best if your local (workstation) user and remote (IAM/Federated) user both expand to the same value as `$USER`.

Source-in the project variables to your environment:

`source build.env <stage|prod>`

`make tf-init`, `make plan` and `make apply`.
